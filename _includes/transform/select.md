Choose columns from a table: columns that are not named will be dropped.
This block is not strictly necessary,
since unneeded columns can simply be ignored,
but discarding unneeded columns can make the display easier to read.
This block is the opposite of [drop](../transform/#drop).

- **column, column**: One or more columns to keep.
