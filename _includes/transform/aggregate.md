When placed inside a [summarize](../transform/#summarize) block,
each of these blocks specifies a column to summarize and a summarization function to use.
If the data has been [grouped](../transform/#group),
one summary row is created for each group.

- **column**: Which column of the table to summarize.
- *drop down*: What summarization function to use.
