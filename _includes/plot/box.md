The Tukey box plot block summarizes a distribution of quantitative values using a set of summary statistics.
The middle tick in the box represents the median.
The lower and upper parts of the box represent the first and third quartile respectively.
The whisker spans from the smallest data to the largest data within the range [Q1 - 1.5 * IQR, Q3 + 1.5 * IQR]
where Q1 and Q3 are the first and third quartiles while IQR is the interquartile range (Q3-Q1).
Any outlier points beyond the whisker are displayed using point marks.
