This block implements logical operations on two values.
It accepts any values on the left and right side
and produces either `true` or `false`.

- *left space*: The left-hand side of the operation.
- *drop down*: Select logical AND or logical OR.
- *right space*: The right-hand side of the operation.

Note that logical AND is only true if *both* sides are true,
while logical OR is true if *either or both* sides are true:
it is not either-or-both rather than one-or-the-other.
