You cannot run blocks without first including a data block within your worskspace.
You cannot place a block on top of a data block,
but you can perform data transformations and visualizations on data blocks by connecting blocks under them.

If you hit the run button without additional blocks
you will see your data displayed in table form on the bottom right of web application.
